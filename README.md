# Human-Pose-Estimation-Using-Deep-Learning
3D human pose estimation from single RGB images, a task complicated by depth ambiguity. Existing methods often treat joint locations independently, risking overfitting on specific datasets. To address this, we propose a solution utilizing Genera- tive Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 3D human pose estimation.
